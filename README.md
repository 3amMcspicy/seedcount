# project
### Project Goal
This program will serve as a visualization tool for forb and grass frequency data. It will also function as a design/visualization tool for forb and grass seed mix design.

## Code
It will somehow convert the csv data into randomly distributed points that are plotted together representing plant density or frequency depending on which input is put in. 

## Data
It will take either a csv of species name, quadrat size, and frequency, or species name, seeds per pound, and PLS.
