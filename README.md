# seedcount
Seedcount will serve as a design tool for Mid-Atlantic Native seed mix design for establishing novel habitat, for example, pollinator or grassland bird habitat. It will help designers visualize their design through the plotting function, and produce a seed mix with percentages by weight from inputted species and desired plant densities (in meters squared).
