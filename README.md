### Project Goal
My program will serve as a visualization tool for forb and grass frequency data. It will also function as a design/visualization tool for forb and grass seed mix design. I am not sure how the user should interact with it yet. 

## Code
It will take the input as a csv and use pandas to calculate expected density for each species based on seeds/pound and PLS. Then, using some combination of np.random and a plotter (I don't know enough about them to say which,) it will plot all the species expected densities on a plot with different symbols mixed together in a random pattern. 
Alternatively, it will take input as a csv of observational data to calculate an approximate density, then do the plot. 

## Data
It will take either a csv of species name, quadrat size, and frequency, or species name, seeds per pound, and PLS. Output will be plots- I'm not sure what formats are possible.
